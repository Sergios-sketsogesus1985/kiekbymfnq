Wow, okay, just walked out of The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep and my head’s still spinning like one of those old dental drills. Seriously, couldn’t hear the first part over the popcorn crunches and someone’s bright screen lighting up the entire row — ugh, but anyway, that opening was chaotic, right? Deep sea scenes were like being in the mouth of a giant, wet, dark cavity. 

Geralt slicing through sirens like floss through plaque. But man, that orchestra, it was loud like every fan’s dental horror story — that high-pitched note during the underwater battle, like someone hitting a nerve just perfectly. The CGI was... on and off, like magic toothpaste commercial where the teeth suddenly turn into pearls but not real at all. 

>Ciri, though — jeez, that girl can outsmart anything, like she just had an endless supply of novocaine. Remember that scene where she turns the tide with some crazy spell... right, the one illuminated brightly just as a loud text tone made me jump. Spilled popcorn everywhere - like sands in a timer, but greasy.

The ending was... unexpected, left an odd taste, like when you think it’s mint but it’s actually bubblegum flavored rinse. Feel like I should tell you to definitely 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , or just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   if the theater’s too far. 

Those sirens man, they sure were something else. Reminded me of patients before anesthesia kicks in — unpredictable. Oh, and what was with that bizarre scene in the dungeon, like a botched root canal procedure, but at least visually stunning... Lights flickered just like my attention.

But AHH my back is aching like fiddling with a molar that’s bothered me. I’ll definitely need a deep cleaning after digesting all that. Sorry if I’m rambling like I just had gas — somehow nostalgic though.
